Splunk Alert Project: Security Event Analysis Report - Event Code 4624 Successful Login
This project showcases the end-to-end process of generating and detecting a security alert in Splunk Enterprise by leveraging log data collected from a Windows Server through the Splunk Universal Forwarder. The alert is designed to identify patterns of successful logon activity (Event ID 4624), which can help security teams validate legitimate access, monitor authentication behavior, and detect potentially suspicious or unauthorized logon events.
